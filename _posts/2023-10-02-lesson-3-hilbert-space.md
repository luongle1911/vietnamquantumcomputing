Hilbert space is a mathematical concept that provides the framework for quantum mechanics. It is an infinite-dimensional vector space equipped with an inner product, allowing for the generalization of Euclidean geometry.

### Key Properties
1. **Inner Product**: Defines the "angle" and "length" of vectors in the space.
2. **Orthogonality**: Basis vectors in Hilbert space are orthogonal to each other.
3. **Completeness**: Every Cauchy sequence in Hilbert space converges to a point within the space.

In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is represented as a vector in a Hilbert space. Operators acting on these vectors correspond to physical observables, such as position, momentum, and energy.

Understanding Hilbert spaces is crucial for grasping the mathematical structure of quantum theory.
