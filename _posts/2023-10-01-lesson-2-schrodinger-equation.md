The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. It is often written as:

$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) $$

Where:
- \( \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t) \) is the wave function of the system.
- \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator.

This equation is central to understanding phenomena at the quantum level, such as particle behavior in potential wells, tunneling, and quantum superposition.

### Key Concepts
1. **Wave Function**: Represents the probability amplitude of a particle's position and momentum.
2. **Hamiltonian**: Represents the total energy of the system, including kinetic and potential energy.
