**CRISPR-Cas9** technology has revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient way to edit DNA. This powerful tool has opened new avenues for treating genetic diseases, developing disease-resistant crops, and understanding fundamental biological processes. Its simplicity and accuracy has made it a staple in laboratories worldwide.

While the therapeutic potential of CRISPR is immense, ethical considerations surrounding *germline editing* and *off-target effects* are actively debated. Researchers are continually refining the technology to enhance its specificity and safety, paving the way for a future where genetic diseases might be routinely cured.

Here's a simple list of gene-editing techniques:
1.  CRISPR-Cas9
2.  TALENs
3.  ZFNs
