The exploration of Mars continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. With new missions like **Perseverance** and its *Ingenuity helicopter*, we are gaining unprecedented insights into the Red Planet's geology, atmosphere, and potential for past or present life.

Understanding Mars's history, particularly its water cycles, is crucial for determining its habitability. Future missions aim to bring Martian samples back to Earth for more detailed analysis, which could provide definitive answers about life beyond our planet.

## 📐 Introduction

This page demonstrates how to write math formulas using LaTeX within Markdown. You can display inline and block-level math beautifully.

---

## 📊 Block-Level Math

You can also render larger formulas using block syntax:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
    e^{-x^2} \, dx
$$

---

## 📈 System of Equations

$$
\begin{cases}
a + b = c \\
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\end{cases}
$$

---

## 🔍 Derivatives and Limits

Inline example: The derivative of $f(x) = x^2$ is $f'(x) = 2x$.  

Block example:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
$$

---

## 🧪 Bonus Equation

$$
E = mc^2
$$

---

# ✅ Conclusion

You can write beautiful math directly in Markdown by using LaTeX. Make sure your Markdown engine or site generator (like Jekyll) supports MathJax or KaTeX to properly render these equations.
